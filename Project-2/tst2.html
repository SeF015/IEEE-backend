    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
    an hour now. On her desk, laying between the copeis
    of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scintist</i>, and all
     the outher scientific journals her work had
     appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
     The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite Book
     since college, and the longer she spent in these
     four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
     <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
     sitting under a poster with Oscar wilde quote
     proclaming that <q>Work is the refuge of
     people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
     many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
     the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Doexribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
     outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em>think
     she had somthing better to do</p>
